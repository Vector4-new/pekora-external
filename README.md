I am not responsible if this gets you banned!

To run this, make sure you have all the modules installed by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.  
If you do not have Visual Studio installed, you will need to install a copy of the [Visual C++ build tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/) to install the LZ4 library.  
Make sure the MSVC build tools and the Windows SDK are downloaded.

You will also need a `luac5.1` binary. Lua binaries are available [here](https://luabinaries.sourceforge.net/). Place the executable in the same path as the `main.py` file.\
